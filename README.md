SparkRoles, based on [Caffeinated Shinobi](https://github.com/caffeinated/shinobi/), brings a simple and light-weight role-based permissions system to Laravel Spark's Team and User models through the following ACL structure:

- Every user can have zero or more roles.
- Every user can have zero or more permissions.
- Every team can have zero or more roles.
- Every team can have zero or more permissions.
- Roles and permissions can be shared between users and teams.
- Optionally, users and teams with a certain role (e.g. `developer`) are added to the Spark developer's array.

Permissions are then inherited to the team/user through the team/user's assigned roles.

This package is a replacement for [Caffeinated Shinobi](https://github.com/caffeinated/shinobi/) when building a project based on `Laravel/Spark`.

## Documentation
You will find user friendly documentation in the [ZiNETHQ SparkRoles Wiki](https://github.com/zinethq/spark-roles/wiki) **BEING UPDATED**

## Quick Installation
1. Install the package through Composer.

    ```bash
    composer require zinethq/spark-roles
    ```

2. Publish the configuration, models, and migrations into your project.

    ```bash
    php artisan vendor:publish --provider="ZiNETHQ\SparkRoles\SparkRolesServiceProvider"
    ```

3. Migrate your database.

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

4. Add the service provider to your project's `config/app.php` file.

    ```php
    ZiNETHQ\SparkRoles\SparkRolesServiceProvider::class,
    ```

5. Add the `CanUseRoles` trait to your `Team` and/or `User` models, for example:

    - `app\Team.php`
    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App;

    use Laravel\Spark\Team as SparkTeam;
    use ZiNETHQ\SparkRoles\Traits\CanHaveRoles;

    class Team extends SparkTeam
    {
        use CanHaveRoles;
        ...
    }
    ```

    - `app\User.php`
    ```php
    <?php

    namespace App;

    use Laravel\Spark\User as SparkUser;
    use ZiNETHQ\SparkRoles\Traits\CanHaveRoles;

    class User extends SparkUser
    {
        use CanHaveRoles;
        ...
    }
    ```

6. **Optional:** If you'd like to dynamically assign the Spark developer array based on team/user roles then open `app\Http\kernel.php` and add the following to the `web` middleware group:

    ```php
    \ZiNETHQ\SparkRoles\Middleware\AddDevelopers::class,
    ```

    This middleware can be controlled (enabled/disabled and choose the role slug that identifies developers) in the package's configuration file.

7. Start using roles for your Spark teams and users!

## Contributing
Fork, edit, pull request. You know the drill.

### Things to do
If you'd like to contribute consider helping with one of the following:

- [ ] Add unit testing.
- [ ] Add a Kiosk based frontend for defining roles and permissions, similar to [Watchtower](https://github.com/SmarchSoftware/watchtower) for [Shinobi](https://github.com/caffeinated/shinobi/).


## Awesome Shinobi

[Caffeinated Shinobi](https://github.com/caffeinated/shinobi/) is an awesome tool for Laravel that adds Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to your user model. There is also a cool UI for Shinobi called [Watchtower](https://github.com/SmarchSoftware/watchtower). Go take a look!
